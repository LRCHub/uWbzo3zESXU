Illusion, illusion
Illusion, illusion

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way
Hoping that I'll never have to say

It's just an illusion

Uh uh uh uh a-ah illusion
Uh uh uh uh a-ah illusion

Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion
Now...
